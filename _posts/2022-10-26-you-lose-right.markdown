NYCHA tenants have special protections that disappear when a development goes through PACT. Your NYCHA lease is replaced with a voucher and you lose the right to:
>* Organize tenants to demand changes. 
>
>* Prevent eviction by having a fair hearing (ex. if your income changes, you could lose your voucher and get evicted without the ability for apeal).
>
>* Funding from your local elected officals to make repairs throughout the building, or provide programs on-site. 
>
>* The emergency transfer program that lets you switch apartments across NYCHA buildings.
>
>* A uniform repair and complaint system that's accountable to oversight by elected officials.
>
>* Pass your apartment on to your family members (sucession rights) as it's optional under PACT not required like NYCHA
>
>* Many other technical protections...
